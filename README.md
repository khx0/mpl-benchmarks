# mpl-benchmarks
Useful matplotlib snippets and plotting routines.
The shown use cases illustrate many advanced matplotlib features by using them in
concrete examples. I personally use this repository to collect such examples,
to provide them for easy reusability and as interesting showcases and with the hope
that they might prove to be useful for interested other parties.
This repository consist of many examples which can also be understood as
template plot scripts for different plotting scenarios.
In particular, I want to illustrate how much potential matplotlib has if one goes beyond the defaults.

For some cases I provide full and minimal versions of the same plotting example.
The full version shows a customized version, how I prefer to use it, whilst the minimal
version is meant to be a minimal requirement python script that focuses on
the single issue that I wish to highlight, without further ado.

## Python and matplotlib versions
All shown examples have been tested both with python 3 (version 3.7.0)
and python 2 (version 2.7.15).
* Python 2.7.15, Matplotlib 2.2.3
* Python 3.7.0,  Matplotlib 3.0.1

Matplotlib version 3.0.2 is under revision for this repository.
