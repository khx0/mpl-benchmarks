# mpl-benchmarks
Useful matplotlib snippets and plotting routines.
I routinely wish to adjust all aspects of matplotlib plots and use this repository
to collect examples that I frequently reuse.

As of 2018-08 I am testing all examples using both python 2 and python 3.
They should all work with python 2.7.15 in conjunction with mpl version 2.2.2
and python 3.7.0  in conjunction with mpl version 2.2.2.
