# mpl-benchmarks
Useful matplotlib snippets and plotting routines.
I routinely wish to adjust all aspects of matplotlib plots and use this repository
to collect examples that I frequently reuse. In particular I want to illustrate
how much potential matplotlib has if one goes beyond the defaults.


For some cases I provide full and minimal versions of the same plotting case.
The full version shows the custom version, how I use them, whilst the minimal
version is meant to be a minimal requirement python script that focuses on
the single issue that I wish to highlight, with out further ado.

## Python and matplotlib versions
All shown examples have been tested both with python 3 (version 3.7.0)
and python 2 (version 2.7.15). In both cases matplotlib
version 2.2.3 was used.
* Python 2.7.15, Matplotlib 2.2.3
* Python 3.7.0,  Matplotlib 2.2.3
