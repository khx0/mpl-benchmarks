# README mpl_arrows

The current implementation of ax.arrow is not straight forward applicable
to work as relative size non-orthogonally oriented arrows.
For these reasons I currently prefer mpl's quiver mpl_arrows
over the arrow implementation. The scripts contained in this section
demonstrate this behavior.
