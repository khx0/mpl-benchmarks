# README mpl_arrows

The current implementation of mpl's arrow is not straight forward applicable
to work as relative sized and non-orthogonally oriented arrows.
For these reasons I currently prefer mpl's quiver over mpl's arrows implementation.
The scripts contained in this section demonstrate this behavior.
Tested with matplotlib version 3.0.3.
