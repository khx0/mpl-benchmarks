# README mpl_arrows

The current implementation of mpl's arrow is not straight forward applicable
to work as relative sized and non-orthogonally oriented arrows (to the best of my know-
ledge). Hence I currently prefer mpl's quiver over mpl's arrows.
The scripts contained in this section demonstrate this behavior.
Tested with matplotlib version 3.1.0.
