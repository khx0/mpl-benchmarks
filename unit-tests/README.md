***How to run all unit test for this project***
1) Open a console from which you can access your Python interpreter.
2) `cd` to the `/unit-tests` folder.
3) Then run
```bash
python3 -m pytest
```
Here I use `python3` as my Python interpreter. For your system, depending on your Python configuration, this might simply be `python`.

***Optional***  

For a more verbose and detailed output, use this command:
```bash
python3 -m pytest -v
```
